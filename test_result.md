# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

    message: "Completed testing of critical issues reported by user. Findings: 1) Seat Layout API is working correctly - no 500 errors observed. 2) Payment Method Selection API exists and responds correctly - accepts both card and PayPal methods. 3) Affiliate Management Dashboard APIs are fully implemented and working correctly. 4) User Profile Features are partially working - credit, invite, and profile update work, but upcoming/past bookings return 500 errors. 5) Admin Management APIs are partially working - only stats API works, others return 500 errors. 6) Booking Flow has issues with seat selection - API returns 'Some seats are already booked' error even for seats that should be available."

    message: "Tested the ObjectId serialization fixes. The admin management APIs (users, routes, buses) now work correctly with the jsonable_encoder and custom_encoder={ObjectId: str} fix. However, the user profile bookings (upcoming/past) endpoints still return 500 errors. The error logs show: 'AttributeError: type object 'ObjectId' has no attribute 'InvalidId''. This is an issue in the error handling code in get_booking_details function. The booking flow with seat selection also still has issues, returning 400 Bad Request with 'Some seats are already booked' error."

    message: "Completed comprehensive frontend testing of the reported issues. Based on visual inspection of the application: 1) Auto-fill Suggestions: Not working - when typing in origin/destination fields, no suggestions dropdown appears. 2) Search Results: The search form is visible and can be filled, but results may not be displaying properly. 3) Seat Selection: Could not fully test due to search results issues. 4) Payment Method Selection: Could not fully test due to seat selection issues. 5) Fleet Management (Add Vehicle): The management dashboard requires login, but the Add Vehicle functionality appears to be present. 6) Route Management (Add Route): The management section exists but the functionality appears to be marked as 'coming soon'. 7) Travel Agent Management (Add Agent): Similar to route management, the section exists but functionality may be limited. 8) Affiliate Management Dashboard: The page loads but may have limited functionality. These issues suggest frontend-backend integration problems that need to be addressed."
